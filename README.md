# Iris Flower Prediction based on the RandomForestClassifier

This project, **Iris Flower Prediction**, is a machine learning application that utilizes the **RandomForestClassifier** to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features. The dataset used is the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements a Random Forest Classifier for accurate prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles dataset cleaning and preparation for training and testing.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and interactive script-based prediction workflow.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates model accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kishorforgge/Iris.git
   cd Iris
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Ensure the Iris dataset is available (usually included in popular ML libraries like sklearn).

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   This script preprocesses the data and trains the RandomForestClassifier.

3. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
   Provide feature values as inputs, and the script will predict the iris species.

4. Evaluate model performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
   View metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.
